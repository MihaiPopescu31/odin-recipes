    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise.
      You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to
      go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.

    <hr />
    <ul>
      <li>Yeast</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Bread Flour</li>
      <li>Olive Oil</li>

    <h2>How to Roll Out Pizza Dough</h2>
    <p>
      Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-making
      process. It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun
      intended). To shape the dough:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature</li>
      <p>
        After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest
        on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax,
        making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.
      </p>
      <li>Prepare Your Surface With Oil</li>
      <p>
        You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of
        flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of
        dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust
        tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons
        of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent
        sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden
        color.
      </p>
      <li>Shape the Dough</li>
      <p>
        You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in
        the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which
        method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too
        much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an
        even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about â…“-inch thick. If
        you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and
        toppings.
      </p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C),
        and lightly grease a pizza pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until
        creamy, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You
        can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to
        make it easier.
      </li>
      <li>Let rest for 5 minutes</li>
      <li>
        Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a
        12-inch circle.
      </li>
      <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
      <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove
        from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
